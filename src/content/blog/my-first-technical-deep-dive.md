# Unraveling the Magic Behind Astro Components

Welcome to my first technical deep dive! In this post, we're going to unravel the magic behind Astro components.

Astro components are the building blocks of your Astro websites. They are similar to components in other frameworks like React or Vue, but with a key difference: **they render on the server by default.** This means no JavaScript is shipped to the client unless you explicitly need it! This "Islands Architecture," as it's often called, is what makes Astro sites so performant. We get the best of both worlds: the developer experience of component-based architecture, and the blazing-fast performance of static site generation.

So, how does this server-side rendering actually work? Let's break it down. When you build your Astro project, Astro takes all your components and pre-renders them into static HTML. This happens during the build process, not in the user's browser. Think of it like baking a cake. You do all the work in the kitchen (the server), and then you serve the finished product (the HTML) to your guests (the users). They get to enjoy the delicious cake without having to do any of the baking themselves!

Now, what about interactivity? That's where the "Islands" part of the architecture comes in. If you have a component that needs to be interactive, like a form or a shopping cart, you can tell Astro to hydrate that specific component on the client-side. This means that only the necessary JavaScript for that island of interactivity is shipped to the browser. The rest of the page remains static HTML, ensuring lightning-fast load times.

Let's look at a simple example. Imagine we have a component called `Counter.astro`:

```astro
---
let count = 0;
---

<div>
  <p>Count: {count}</p>
  <button onclick={() => count++}>Increment</button>
</div>
```

In a typical framework, this would ship JavaScript to the client to handle the onclick event. But in Astro, this component will be rendered to static HTML during build. The button will be there, but it won't do anything. It's just a regular HTML button.

Now, let's say we do want the button to increment the counter. We can make this an "island" by adding the client:load directive:
